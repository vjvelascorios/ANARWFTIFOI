# Absolutely Not a Repository With Fonts That I Found On Internet

Well, this IS NOT a repo with fonts that I found on the Internet, absolutely not. 

You can download files or the entire zip with family folder (look in `/Archive/`).

This begin with futura font, but I will add some fonts in the future.


## Changes and updates

- 2022-10-09: futura font.
- 2022-10-15: more futura's, new helvetica and bodoni folder fonts.

## Disclaimer or something

The main reason for this repository is that I regularly miss my fonts, and after some months when I changes my distro o computer I have to seek on some tricky pages for this or in my drives... what a waste of time, right?


So, this repo have no intentions to be over the law, but if you think that some font is of your propperty, send me a message and I will respond your request... some day. :)
